# Focus Tracker Advance - README

## Overview

**Focus Tracker Advance** is a simple, yet effective Python-based project designed to help users improve their focus and productivity. This tool tracks focus sessions by monitoring phone usage, including the number of times the phone is picked up, the total time spent on the phone, and the maximum uninterrupted focus duration. It provides valuable insights for users aiming to reduce distractions and build better focus habits.

## Features

1. **Phone Pickup Tracking**: Counts the number of times the user picks up their phone during a focus session.
2. **Total Phone Usage Duration**: Tracks the cumulative time spent on the phone during the session.
3. **Maximum Focus Time**: Calculates the longest uninterrupted period of focus within the session.

## File Structure

This project contains only one file:
- `focus_tracker_advance.py`: The main script containing all the functionality for tracking focus sessions.

---

## How It Works

1. The program runs a focus session for the user.
2. During the session, it:
   - Monitors phone pickups and logs each instance.
   - Tracks the duration of phone usage.
   - Identifies periods of uninterrupted focus.
3. At the end of the session, the program provides a summary report with:
   - Total phone pickups.
   - Total time spent on the phone.
   - The maximum focus time achieved.
